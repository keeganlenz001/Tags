        <h2><pre>&lt;strong&gt;</pre></h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is essentially another way of bolding words.
            <br>
            There are slight differences between the two tags, but they essentially do the same thing.
            <br>
            So one way of making text bold is using the &lt;strong&gt; tag.
            <br>
            <br>
            Example: <strong>This is in the &lt;strong&gt; tag. </strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            Example: <b>This is in the &lt;b&gt; tag.</b>
        </p>
        <br>


        <h2><pre>&lt;small&gt;</pre></h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does exaclty what it sounds like it does, it makes the font size smaller.
            <br>
            Essentially this replaces the standard way you might make a font size smaller in something like google docs.
            <br>
            In order to make the font size smaller in HTML you must use &lt;small&gt;.
            <br>
            <br>
            Example: <small>This is in the &lt;small&gt; tag.</small>
        </p>
        <br>


        <h2><pre>&lt;hr&gt;</pre></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As seen above, you might notice a line underneath the header for this section.
            <br>
            This is entirely due to the &lt;hr&gt; which essentially draws a big line across the screen.
            <br>
            In order to do this you must use the &lt;hr&gt; tag.
            <br>
            <br>
            Example: <hr>This is underneath the first &lt;hr&gt; tag and above the second &lt;hr&gt; tag. <hr>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2><pre>&lt;br&gt;</pre></h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will essentially substitute the "enter" key on your keyboard.
            <br>You might think that you can just enter in the actual code, however this is not how coding works.
            <br>If you did want the enters in your code to affect the webpage by itself, you would have to use the &lt;pre&gt; tag.
            <br>In order to enter without using &lt;pre&gt; you must use &lt;br&gt;
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Example:<br> This sentence<br> has no "enters"<br> in the code,<br> but on the page<br> it does.
            <br>
            <br>Example: 
<pre>This sentence
has enters in the code
and on the page
because it uses 
the &lt;pre&gt; tag.
</pre>
        </p>
